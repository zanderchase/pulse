            <p class="description-text">Hey everyone! </p>

            <p class="description-text">For the past four months we (Dylan and Zander) have been studying abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina. During our time here we’ve been able to travel around the country seeing beautiful landscapes, experiencing unique cultures, and befriending incredible people. Although each region of Argentina seems to be vastly different from the next, we’ve found one underlying commonality—amazing local artisans. </p>
            
            <p class="description-text">Every Argentine town and city we’ve been to hosts community fairs where local artists display their unique crafts to both residents and tourists alike. Every time we go to one of these fairs and talk with the creators themselves, we are enamored. We are enamored by the beauty of the products, we are enamored by the passion that they put into their craft, and we are enamored by their incredible life stories. </p>
            
            <p class="description-text"> We designed Pulse to shine light on this untouched beauty. </p>
            
            <p class="description-text"> No matter your ability to travel, you can support amazing artisans around the world. Each purchase you make not only helps these creators provide for themselves and their families, but also shows your appreciation for the craft to which they have dedicated their lives. </p>
            
            <p class="description-text"> We are still at an early stage in our idea, so for now we are only displaying bracelets made by three of our favorite artisans. With your support, we hope to further expand our selection to a variety of different, handcrafted products. </p>
            
            <p class="description-text"> Check out our artisans’ amazing bracelets below!</p>

                  <p class="description-text">Alberto was born and raised in the the northern Argentine city of Tucuman, hence his nickname Tucu. 
                  When he was younger he used to work as a muralist, but one day on the job, 22 years ago, he suffered a tragic accident. While painting on the side of a building, the rope supporting his platform snapped and he fell four stories to the ground. Alberto was left with a split skull, complete blindness, and critical damage to rest of his body. He was flown to Buenos Aires in order to receive the best medical care, and, fortunately, he survived. 
                  Today, Alberto lives with screws and plates in every part of his body, and partial blindness. Despite his trauma and being handicapped, he receives little aid from the government and must continue working until his body physically does not let him anymore. 
                  However, despite the unimaginable suffering that he has faced and continues to face every day, he always has a smile on his face. According to Tucu, pain is only mental, and creating these works of art allows him to distract himself from the bad and focus on the good.

                  <p class="description-text">Ana was born and raised in Colombia. There she taught her herself how to create bracelets and necklaces, however soon it became apparent that her craft was unsustainable there. A lack of support for the artisans in Colombia led her to move to Buenos Aires two years ago in order to continue with her passion. She explained how here in Argentina, the government promotes the arts by making fairs financially accessible to all creators. Though she misses her family, she must stay here in Argentina in order to make a living. 

                  Ana is a little bit shy and did not want her face in the picture.

                   Juan is a native of Buenos Aires. From an early age he found a love for travel. During his stays in stays at hostels around Argentina and South America, other travelers taught him how to make bracelets and necklaces. He soon found a passion for the art, as he could easily transport the materials with him in his backpack and pass the time creating unique pieces. He was able to incorporate designs native to the communities he visited in each one of his bracelets and necklaces. 
                   To this day, Juan continues to source many of his products and derive many of his designs from the indigenous argentine. He frequently uses symbols like the Chakana Andina, which is an ancient andina cross dating back over 4 thousand years ago that symbolizes the connection between humans and the greater powers.
